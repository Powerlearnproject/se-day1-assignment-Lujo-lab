Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the application of engineering principles that lead to the development and maintenance of quality software systems.
Its importance is seen in the development of sosftware stystems and applications that are useful in sustaining daily living such as communication and health care.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a.Development of programming languages
b.Establishment of software engineering as a discpline in 1960s
c.Structured programming in the 1970s
d.The rise of agile methodologies in 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a.Requirements-involves gathering user needs and requirements
b.Design-Entails a high level detailed design of software architecture and user interface
c.Implementation-Involves wtiting code to develop the software according to specified designs
d.Testing-Involves conducting tests to ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements
e.Deployment-Software is released to intended users or customers
f.Maintenance-Involves providing ongoing support which can include updates and enehancements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a sequential appraoch to software development that follows dintinct phases such as reuirements, design, implementation flowing donwards one after the other like a waterfall while Agile methodologies use an iterative and incremental approach focussing on flexibility, collaboration and respose to changes.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a.Software developer roles: writes code and implements software solutions
b.Quality Assurance Engineer roles: Ensures quality of software through testing plans
c.Project Manager:Oversees the planning and exection of software systems

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suits that provide comprehensive tools for writing andtesting code. Exaples incude:Visual studio, Eclipse
Version Control Systems(VCS) are software tools used to tarck changes to source code and help coordinate team work on similar project. Exaples include: Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a.Tight deadlines-Developers can be subject to pressure to develop sofware within tight time constraints which can risk quality of software
b.Change in requirements-Requirements may change while in the development process and this may cause changes in scope or lead to delays
c.Technical Debt-May arise from shortcusts taken duiring development which affect future development and call for high maintenece costs.
Challenges can be overcome by: use of effective communication,proper planning of tasks, regular assessment of task and use of agile menthods.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a.Unit Testing-Involves testing individual components of a software
b.Integration Testing-Tests conducted on interations between different components or systems
c.System Testing-They are tests undertaken on the whole software system
d.Acceptance Testing-Tests conducted on software against user requirements to ensure they fit needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
The art of providing well structures questions to AI systems to ensure deirable response can be genearted by the AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Provide recipe for a healthy meal.
Improved prompt: Provide a breakfast recipe for 1. Should help towards weight loss.
Explanantion: The vague prompt does not provide specificity such as what time of meal and what health targets are needed. The Improved prompt is able to specify the type of meal(breakfast) and also the size by providing number. It also provide the needed health targets making it a better prompt than the first.
